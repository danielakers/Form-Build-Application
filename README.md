# Form-Build-Application
assignment for Wix

The Server is written in python. The website was made using flask.

To run the app, you need to run the server in the terminal(python app.py), and then open localhost:5000 in you browser.

Unfourtantley there a some rejections I didn't fix yet:

1. When entering a new field for a form, you do not see all the fields you made on the same page,
only when you finish making the form.
2. When filling the form your made, when you answer one field, it submits that answer for all the fields, and
the amount of submissions goes up accordingly (I know this is a big problem).

Despite the rejections, I really enjoyed working on this project. Got to learn a lot about SQL, Python and FLASK.

Enjoy my work,

Thanks,

Daniel Levanon
